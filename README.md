# GT-CS3630-Robotics-Projects

This repository contains the projects completed as a part of the CS 3630 Robotics and Perception course at Georgia Tech. The course website can be found [here](https://www.roboticsbook.org/intro.html).

## Project Descriptions

### [Project 0: Python Introduction](./Project0)
A short introduction to coding in Python, covering basic syntax, data structures, and control structures.

### [Project 1: Trash Sorting Robot](./Project1)
Implementation of the trash sorting robot described in Chapter 2 of the textbook. The robot is designed to sort trash based on their material types.

### [Project 2: Vacuum Cleaning Robot](./Project2)
Implementation of the vacuum cleaning robot described in Chapter 3 of the textbook. The robot is designed to navigate and clean a given environment.

### [Project 3: Markov Localization, Particle Filtering, and Path Following](./Project3)
This project explores Markov localization, particle filtering, and path following techniques for robotic systems. These techniques help robots maintain an accurate estimate of their position in the environment and navigate through it.

### [Project 4: Object Detection and Path Planning](./Project4)
Implementation of object detection and path planning for a differential drive robot. The robot detects objects in its environment and plans a path to navigate around them.

### [Project 5: ICP and GTSAM for SLAM](./Project5)
Implementation of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and GTSAM (Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping) library for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) on LIDAR scans from a self-driving vehicle.

### [Project 6: 3D RRT for Aerial Drones](./Project6)
Implementation of 3D Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) for trajectory optimization and path planning of aerial drones. This project focuses on efficient path planning for drones in 3D environments.

## Setup and Usage

Each project folder contains a Jupyter Notebook with the implementation and explanation of the respective project. To run the notebooks, you'll need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. For installation instructions, please refer to the [official Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.org/install).

After setting up Jupyter, navigate to the project folder and run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser, where you can open the desired notebook and execute the code cells.
